# Support Vector Machines (SVM) Tutorial
## Introduction
This project demonstrates the implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a powerful supervised learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. The focus is on understanding SVMs through training, evaluating, and visualizing decision boundaries with linear kernels.
## Project Overview
- **Dataset:** A 2D dataset retrieved from Kaggle, featuring two numerical features (X1, X2) and a target label (y).
- **Objective:** Classify data points using SVMs and visualize the decision boundaries for various kernels.
- **Key Features:**
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
  - Model training and evaluation using SVM with different kernels.
  - Decision boundary visualization to understand classification performance.

## File Structure
- SVM_Tutorial.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the step-by-step implementation.
- Aggregation.txt: Dataset file used in the project.
- README.md: Project documentation.
- Plots generated during the execution are embedded in the notebook.

## Usage
1. Open the SVM_Tutorial.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run each cell sequentially to:
    - Perform data analysis.
    - Train the SVM model with various kernels.
    - Visualize decision boundaries.

## Dataset
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle:
2D Classification Dataset for SVM (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/outsiders17711/2d-datasets).
